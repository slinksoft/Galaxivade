# Galaxivade
An Galaga x Space Invader crossover Android game developed in Game Maker Studio

This is my second Android game, Galaxivade. Similar to SpaceInvade v2, this game is a high-scoring action 2D shooter game, where when you advanced each level, the aliens and alien missiles come down faster. For more details on the gameplay and credits, please watch the video below. The game was developed in Game Maker Studio.
